            <h2>This website is a resource center to help everyone understand basic immunology</h2>
            <p>
                With the recent events of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become <i>very</i><b> important</b> for everyone to have a broad understanding of the defense mechanisms that our bodies have in place when under attack by bacteria, parasites, and
                viruses. This mechanism is called the Immune System and it is a collection of cells that are dedicated to defending off pathogens. A pathogen is any organism that has the potential to cause infection. Most pathogens come in the form of
                microscopic organisms such as bacteria, parasites, fungi, and viruses. Pathogens can enter the human body, invade their host's cells, replicate themselves, and transmit infection to other people. However, the human body has evolved genetic
                resistance to many of these organisms and can acquire immunity to these endemic diseases. Immunity is the protection of the human body from infection. This can be accomplished by previous exposure or vaccination (immunization) to the virus.


            </p>
            <p>Immunology is the study of the physiological mechanisms that defend and protect the human body from the invasion of pathogens. The field of immunology was founded in science and medicine during observation of diseases during epidemics. To
                get a better understanding of basic immunological concepts please continue to <a href="Introductiontoimmunology.html"><b>Introduction to Immunology</b></a></p>
