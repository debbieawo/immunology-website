            <p>
                We know that the immune system is our protector to infectious disease, but do we know how it does this?</p>
            <p>Well, the human body accomplishes this by a collection of cells, tissues, and molecules that help resist infections by initiating an <b>immune response</b>. The first line of defense against infection comes in the form of your body's own barrier.
                This is the skin, which is formed from epithelium and many layers of keratinized cells.This also includes the epithelial linings such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Mucosal surfaces also play a major role by secreting
                mucus that contains enzymes and proteins that aid in the protection of the barriers.</p>
            <p>Now, lets learn about <a href="InnatevsAdaptive.html"><b>Innate vs. Adaptive Immunity</b></a>.</p>
