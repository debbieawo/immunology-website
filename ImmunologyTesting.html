                So what happens when you come down with a virus or bacterial infection? Well, you usually go to the doctor so he can figure out what kind of infection it is. To do this, the doctor will take a sample (blood or swab) and have it tested for what he thinks
                is the potential culprit. For example, say you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and go to your nearest testing center. Once there, they can run a few different tests. If they believe you have the virus currently, they will collect
                a nasopharyngeal swab that is sent to the lab for PCR that will detect the viral DNA sequence. With the antibody testing, a blood sample is taken to find antibodies specific to the Coronavirus and also to understand if you were infected
                in the past.</p>
